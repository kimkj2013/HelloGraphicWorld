## Artist Statement
For computer scientists, “Hello World” is one of ‘trivial’ terms when to start programming. “Hello Graphic World” will introduce you all to the ‘graphic’ world of computer science. This provides you to draw random things. Color will be selected randomly, but it won’t be messy; rather, those random colors harmonized in a beautiful way. Also, this program can draw fractal triangles, Julia and Mandelbrot set.
