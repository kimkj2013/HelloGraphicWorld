 * 
 * "Hello, Graphic World!" is a computer graphic work which will be submitted to
 * the Miami University Art Exhibition: Creativity and Innovation ~ A Student
 * Response.
 * 
 * Author Description: This program is implemented by Kwangju Kim, a junior-year
 * student studying computer science in Miami University. He was born in Daegu,
 * South Korea on October 14, 1994, and has lived in Ohio since 2013. He pursued
 * various software development opportunities, which include few hackathons and
 * in-class projects. He has started coding when he was a high school student,
 * to become a certified Java programmer granted by Oracle (License no:
 * 233734906OCPJSE6P) in August 2014.
 *

 * 
 * Work Description: For computer scientists, "Hello, World!" is one of
 * 'trivial' terms when to start programming. Many programmers have started
 * their coding with printing "Hello, World!". As such, "Hello, Graphic World!"
 * will introduce you all to the 'graphic' world of computer science. This
 * provides you to draw random things. Color will be selected randomly, but it
 * won't mess your art work; rather, those random colors will harmonize
 * themselves in a beautiful way.
 * 
 * Furthermore, this program has implemented some mathematical concepts. For
 * example, this program draws graphical image of Julia and Mandelbrot set,
 * implementing complex numbers and its convergence/divergence. You can also
 * draw fractal triangles.
 * 
 * This is the main class is which will be used to call the main JFrame thread.
